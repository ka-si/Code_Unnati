# Steps For Ml Modeling

* x , y specification
 x = independent
 y = dependent
 
* data into 2 part
  
  train 60%-80%
  test 20%-40%
  
* model.fitting 
* checking model preformance using confusion matix

* R2  = It tells Us goodness if of best fit line

    -infinty < R2  <1
    if R2 is 1 then data is best fitted on the model

    decresing the r2 displays the data is generaing more error through the best fit

* Mean Squared Error 
    (sum(y(train)-y(pred))^2)/n
    
* Mean Absolute Error
    (abs(sum(y(train)-y(pred))))/n
